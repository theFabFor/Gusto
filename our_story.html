                    <p>Pizza makes Denis Boaro happy.
                    OK, lots of things make him happy. Cooking his grandma’s tomato sauce for his wife and three kids. Fresh pasta. Fresh basil. Garlic. Good wine. Nice restaurants. Mozzarella.</p>
                    <p>But it’s pizza that takes him back to his native Italy, when his dad would send him to the bakery next door to the family’s hotel/restaurant for bread, and the baker would let him experiment with the pizza dough.</p>
                    <p>“I remember the smell of the yeast and the water and flour together – it attracts me,” he says. “I just love it.”</p>
                    <p>Boaro co-owns Basil Seasonal Dining in Carmel (831-626-8226), the first certified green restaurant in the county, a leader in organic and fresh fare and, thanks to the intimate and easy vibe he helps cultivate personally – and some squid ink linguine, five-hour-braised beef cheeks and lavender-rabbit sausage – one of the great eateries by the sea.</p>
                    <p>“Carmel is so saturated,” Boaro says. “I want to be able to expand where we can offer a different quality of food, a different kind of service and experience. I think it makes sense.”</p>
                    <p>Thinner, crunchier Northern Italian style pizzas will star, coming from the wood-burning oven immediately visible upon entering Gusto.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>Boaro anticipates designing a fermented-Pinot pizza dough to add a unique accent. Chef Michelle Cremonese will act as consulting chef until things are off the ground and provide the from-scratch pastas from his nearby commercial kitchen, the beautiful butternut squash ravioli and thicker, hollow spaghetti (or bigoli) among them. Breads will come from Palermo Bakery, a well known regional artisan bakery.</p>
                    <p>Pricing according to Boaro is “Affordable, we don’t want to scare anybody. It’s not a fine dining restaurant.” A take-out mini deli offers handmade Bigoli pastas,sauces, and balsamics. A full bar offers tradional cocktails, Gusto specialities as well as Italian dessert wines.</p>
                    <p>The most promising addition will be Boaro’s parents, whom he will successfully import after lobbying for the move for years. After running a hotel and Italian restaurant for 45 years, they’ll take over the sauce-and starter-dough-making duties in the mornings.</p>
                    <p>That will contribute to the Italian feeling Boaro wants to extend from “the way you get greeted to the moment you leave.”</p>
                    <p>Anyone who’s dined with him at Basil knows the welcoming element is compulsive for Boaro, one of those individuals born for the hospitality industry.</p>
                    <p>“People will come there for the food and for us, because we make people feel special,” he says. “I know it’s easy to say that, and a lot of restaurants do. But there’s something between saying and doing. I have it in my blood.”</p>
                    <p>So come by and enjoy!</p>
